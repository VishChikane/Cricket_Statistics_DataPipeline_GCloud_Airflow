# Cricket_Statistics_DataPipeline_GCloud_Airflow
This project showcases the development of a data pipeline for cricket statistics using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Apache Airflow. The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience in designing and implementing a scalable data pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes cricket data.

# Features
Data Extraction: Collect cricket statistics from various sources including APIs, web scraping, and cloud storage.

Data Transformation: Clean, transform, and aggregate data using GCP tools like Dataflow and BigQuery.

Data Loading: Load the processed data into a data warehouse for analysis and visualization.

Orchestration and Scheduling: Manage and schedule the data pipeline using Apache Airflow.

Scalability and Performance: Utilize the power of Google Cloud for efficient data processing and storage.

# Technologies Used
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud services used for data processing, storage, and analysis.

Apache Airflow: An open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

BigQuery: A fully-managed data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data.

Dataflow: A fully managed service for stream and batch processing.
